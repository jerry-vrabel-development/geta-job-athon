# Hi Viewers
<!-- This app is actively being built. Repo @ ==> https://github.com/jerry-vrabel-development/geta-job-athon -->

Feel free to say "Hi" by sending a chat... or donate. Cause this dev is jobless.  
All donations are incredibly appreciated (and unfortunately needed)

Over a year... 100's of resumes sent out to the sound of crickets. A few second place ribbons received, but they don't pay the bills. I've got bills, very late ones at that.

Anyhooo. I am available for work, projects, teams... all the good stuff

Please reach out at <jerry.vrabel.development@gmail.com> with any opportunities
